# Chat with SQL Database using LLMs

Welcome to the **Chat with SQL Database using LLMs** repository! In this project, we explore how to create an intelligent chat agent that interacts with an SQL database using Large Language Models (LLMs). By combining LangChain and OpenAI's LLMs (such as ChatGPT), we enable users to query an MS SQL Server in natural language.

## Key Concepts

- **SQL Server**: Microsoft's relational database management system (RDBMS) that securely stores, manages, and analyzes data using SQL queries.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Advanced models like ChatGPT that understand and generate human-like text based on natural language inputs.
- **LangChain**: A toolkit that simplifies LLM interactions and management, allowing developers to focus on building applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:
   - Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Explore the provided notebook**:
   - `chat.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to set up an NLP SQL agent for your MS SQL instance. This agent translates user queries expressed in everyday language into executable SQL queries.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed.

4. **Customize and Experiment**:
   - Adapt the examples to your specific SQL use case.
   - Explore different LLMs and fine-tuning strategies.

Feel free to explore and enhance your SQL interactions with LLMs! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
